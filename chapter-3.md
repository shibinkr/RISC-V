# Chapter 3: The RISC-V Assembly Workbook

## 3.1: Features of RISC-V Assembly Language

The RISC-V assembly language reflects the design goals of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It emphasizes simplicity, consistency, and direct control over the hardware. This chapter outlines key features that make RISC-V assembly both practical and educational.

### 1. Designed with Simplicity in Mind

RISC-V was created to be **simple and minimal**, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Every instruction follows a clean format, and the instruction set contains only what is necessary to write efficient programs.

- **Benefit**: Easier to learn and implement.
- **Example**: All base instructions are 32 bits wide, simplifying decoding and hardware design.

---

### 2. Three-Operand Format for Binary Operations

Most arithmetic and logical operations follow a **three-operand format**:

```assembly
add x3, x1, x2   # x3 = x1 + x2
```
- **Two source registers**: `x1`, `x2`
- **One destination register**: `x3`

This consistent pattern simplifies both coding and CPU instruction decoding.

- **Benefit**: Reduces confusion and supports cleaner, more efficient hardware pipelines.

### 3. Support for Pseudoinstructions

RISC-V includes **pseudoinstructions** to make assembly code more readable and concise. These are not actual instructions in the hardware but are automatically translated by the assembler into valid machine instructions.

- **Example**:
  ```assembly
  li x5, 100   # Load immediate value 100 into register x5
  ```

- **Translates to**:
  ```assembly
  addi x5, x0, 100

- **Why this matters**: Pseudoinstructions make the assembly code easier to write and read, especially for common tasks. They’re like syntactic sugar that simplifies development without changing the underlying machine code behavior.

---

### 4. Direct Translation to Machine Language

Each RISC-V assembly instruction has a one-to-one (or in some cases, one-to-few for pseudoinstructions) mapping to machine code.

- **Example**:
  ```assembly
  add x3, x1, x2    →    0x002081B3	
  ```
**Why this matters**: This direct translation allows for:

- Efficient assemblers and disassemblers  
- Predictable performance  
- Easy debugging and reverse engineering  
- Reliable educational tools for learning how CPUs execute instructions
